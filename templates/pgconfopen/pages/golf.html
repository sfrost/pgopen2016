            <h3>Announcing the First Annual PostgresOpen Golf Tournament!</h3>

            <p>Join us for a round of golf to benefit the <a href="http://postgresql.us/node/167">United States PostgreSQL Associationâ€™s Diversity Scholarship Fund</a>!
              This scholarship fund provides assistance to underrepresented groups to participate in PostgreSQL events, to foster their inclusion in our community.  All proceeds from this event will be donated to the scholarship fund and we will announce the total raised at the conference closing session!

            <p>This is the first PostgreSQL-related event of its kind, so join us in making it a rousing success!</p>

            <p>All skill levels from beginner to pro are welcome and encouraged to attend this charity event!</p>

            <p>This event will be held on Friday, September 16th, 2016 at a golf course near the conference hotel.  Transportation to and from the course will be provided from the Westin.
