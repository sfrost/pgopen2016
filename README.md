PostgresOpen 2016 Django Website

This is a very simple/stupid django application for the website:

  https://2016.postgresopen.org

Use:

  scripts/pushsite

to deploy changes to the website/application in /srv/www.

There is also a scripts/pushsite.beta for pushing changes to the
beta2016.postgresopen.org site.
